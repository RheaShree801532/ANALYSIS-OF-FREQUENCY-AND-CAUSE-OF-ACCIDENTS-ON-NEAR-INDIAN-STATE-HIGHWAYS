# ANALYSIS-OF-FREQUENCY-AND-CAUSE-OF-ACCIDENTS-ON-NEAR-INDIAN-STATE-HIGHWAYS


This project focuses on analyzing road accidents in India, particularly on and near state highways, to identify patterns, outliers, and potential preventative measures. The data is derived from two primary datasets: Road_Accidents_data (Month and Hourly wise) and India_Injury_Road_Accident_Fatality_2017. The combined dataset contains over 120,000 records and 34 fields, providing comprehensive information about accident causes, road alignment, driver details, and the severity of casualties.

The main goal is to lower the number and severity of accidents by offering data-driven insights that can inform policies and preventative measures.

**Problem Statement**
Highway and near-highway accidents contribute to high death tolls, serious injuries, and significant financial losses. Despite the urgency, effective preventative measures are hampered by incomplete and fragmented data. This project aims to address this challenge by analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and offering insights into accident circumstances to inform data-backed interventions.
